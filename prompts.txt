- The output must be a list of such question-answer objects.
- Each object must contain:

     - If no diagram → set: id: 'n/a', coordinates: 'n/a', diagram_class: 'n/a'.
  - pages: The page number of the content ,Must always be shown as a list of integers in square brackets.

- Understand the context to group full question-answer blocks together.
- Maintain the output structure and avoid inserting extra commentary or descriptions.
- Any text that is struck through (strikethrough formatting) must be completely ignored and excluded from the output.
- Ignore any template, header, footer, or decorative elements such as 'Date', 'Page', and similar non-content areas that do not contribute to the main educational material

# - Moves header/footer exclusion to a more prominent position in rules

 V4 PROMPT
 THIS IS FOR COORDS AND TEXT FROM GEMINI PRO
 Given a PDF document, for each page:
Carefully extract all text content from the PDF (Ignore any template, header or headings of the page, footer, or decorative elements such as 'Date', 'Page'.), maintaining the exact order and formatting as it appears.
For each text block detected, return a JSON array with:
The page number (page_number).
The OCR text (text).
The bounding box coordinates in the format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax], where:
ymin is the top vertical coordinate of the text box,
xmin is the left horizontal coordinate of the text box,
ymax is the bottom vertical coordinate of the text box,
xmax is the right horizontal coordinate of the text box.
If there is no text detected on a page, return an empty list for that page. Please provide the data for each page in the following JSON format
Example JSON Output (for one page):

[
  {
    "page_number": 1,
    "text": "Introduction to AI",
    "bbox": [50, 100, 150, 300]
  },
  {
    "page_number": 1,
    "text": "This document discusses the basics of AI.",
    "bbox": [160, 110, 210, 350]
  },
  {
    "page_number": 2,
    "text": "Conclusion and future work",
    "bbox": [80, 50, 130, 250]
  }
]
Notes for the OCR and PDF Processing:
Page Numbering: Each page's results should be nested under the page_number field to indicate which page the text belongs to.
Bounding Box Format: Each detected text's bounding box will be represented as [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].
OCR Text: Include the actual OCR-detected text for each bounding box.
Empty Pages: If a page contains no text, return an empty list for that page (e.g., "page_number": 3, "text": []).

Carefully extract all text content from the PDF, ignoring any template, headers, headings of the page, footer, or decorative elements such as 'Date', 'Page', 'General instructions', 'Time Allowed', etc. Maintain the exact order and formatting as it appears in the PDF.
Preserve all mathematical equations, formulas, and special characters exactly as they appear in the PDF.
Do not add any headers, descriptions, or labels to the output.
For each question, if the block "For visually impaired students" follows the question, treat this block as a separate entry with the same question number followed by 'v'. For example, if the original question number is 24, the block for visually impaired students should be labeled `24v`. This should be applied **only** if the "For visually impaired students" block is present; otherwise, it should not be included.
Output the extracted text content in the following JSON format:
[
  {
    "question_number": 24,
    "section_number": "A",
    "question_ocr_text": "The above figure shows the formation of an image by a lens shown by a thick line.<Image_1>",

The JSON format is now clearly defined:
question_number: The unique identifier for each question.
section_number: The section in which the question belongs (e.g., "A", "B").
question_ocr_text: The extracted question text, along with any diagrams/Images or special content .
mark: The mark or score for the question (this was incomplete in your original prompt, so now it's included).
Pages : Page number of the question content
