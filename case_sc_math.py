Carefully extract all text content from the PDF, ignoring any template, headers, headings of the page, footer, or decorative elements such as 'Date', 'Page', 'General instructions', 'Time Allowed', etc. Maintain the exact order and formatting as it appears in the PDF.
Preserve all mathematical equations, formulas, special characters, and explanations exactly as they appear in the PDF.
Do not add any headers, descriptions, or labels to the output.
For each question:
- If the question is broken into multiple sections (e.g., A, B, C), treat them as part of the same question and include all the text under the same `question_number`. For example, if a question has parts A, B, and C, it should be labeled as `question_number: 24_A`, `question_number: 24_B`, and `question_number: 24_C`.
- If options (e.g., A, B, C, D) are present as part of the question, do not separate them. Include them as part of the main question content in the `question_ocr_text`. For example, "A) Option 1, B) Option 2, C) Option 3".
- If the block "For visually impaired students" follows the question, treat this block as a separate entry with the same question number followed by 'v'. For example, if the original question number is 24, the block for visually impaired students should be labeled `24v`. This should be applied **only** if the "For visually impaired students" block is present; otherwise, it should not be included.
Output the extracted text content in the following JSON format:

The JSON format is now clearly defined:
question_number: The unique identifier for each question.
If a question has marks:
- Include the `mark` field with the relevant score.
- If no marks are provided for the question, set `mark` as "na".
section_number: The section in which the question belongs (e.g., "A", "B").
question_ocr_text: The extracted question text, along with any diagrams/Images or special content .
mark: The mark or score for the question (this was incomplete in your original prompt, so now it's included).
Pages : Page number of the question content
question_number_v : this is for the content of the quesiton under "For visually impaired students"
